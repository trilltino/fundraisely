//! # Initialize Instruction
//!
//! One-time admin setup of global platform configuration and economic parameters.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This instruction creates the singleton GlobalConfig PDA that governs all fundraising rooms
//! on the platform. It must be called exactly once by the program admin before any rooms can
//! be created. This initialization sets immutable economic rules that ensure every room
//! maintains the platform's charitable mission (minimum 40% to charity).
//!
//! ## Role in Program Architecture
//!
//! Initialize is the **first instruction** that must be executed in the program lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. initialize        ← Creates GlobalConfig PDA (THIS INSTRUCTION)
//! 2. init_pool_room    ← Hosts create rooms (validates against GlobalConfig)
//! 3. join_room         ← Players join rooms
//! 4. end_room          ← Host distributes funds to platform/charity/winners
//! ```
//!
//! Without initialization, all other instructions will fail because they require the GlobalConfig
//! account to exist for validation.
//!
//! ## What This Instruction Does
//!
//! 1. **Creates GlobalConfig PDA**: Initializes the singleton config account using seed ["global-config"]
//! 2. **Sets Admin Authority**: Records the admin's pubkey for future config updates
//! 3. **Configures Wallets**: Sets platform_wallet and charity_wallet for fund routing
//! 4. **Defines Economic Constraints**: Sets maximum/minimum fee percentages:
//!    - platform_fee_bps: 2000 (20% fixed platform fee)
//!    - max_host_fee_bps: 500 (5% maximum host can take)
//!    - max_prize_pool_bps: 3500 (35% maximum for prizes)
//!    - min_charity_bps: 4000 (40% minimum must go to charity)
//! 5. **Sets Emergency Controls**: Initializes emergency_pause flag to false
//!
//! ## Economic Model Enforcement
//!
//! The economic parameters set here cannot be bypassed by room creators:
//!
//! ```text
//! Every room must satisfy:
//!   platform_fee (20%) + host_fee (0-5%) + prizes (0-35%) + charity (40%+) = 100%
//!
//! GlobalConfig enforces:
//!   - Platform fee is always exactly 20% (fixed)
//!   - Host fee cannot exceed 5%
//!   - Prize pool cannot exceed 35%
//!   - Charity must receive at least 40% (calculated as remainder)
//!
//! This ensures the platform maintains its charitable mission while allowing
//! hosts flexibility in prize pool and host fee allocation.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Frontend Integration
//!
//! The frontend doesn't typically call this instruction (admin-only), but it does fetch
//! the GlobalConfig to display platform rules and validate room creation inputs:
//!
//! ```typescript
//! // Fetch global configuration
//! const [globalConfigPDA] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
//!   [Buffer.from("global-config")],
//!   program.programId
//! );
//!
//! const globalConfig = await program.account.globalConfig.fetch(globalConfigPDA);
//!
//! // Display to users
//! console.log(`Platform fee: ${globalConfig.platformFeeBps / 100}%`);
//! console.log(`Max host fee: ${globalConfig.maxHostFeeBps / 100}%`);
//! console.log(`Max prize pool: ${globalConfig.maxPrizePoolBps / 100}%`);
//! console.log(`Min charity: ${globalConfig.minCharityBps / 100}%`);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Security Considerations
//!
//! - **One-Time Operation**: Once created, GlobalConfig cannot be re-initialized
//! - **Admin Authority**: Only the admin pubkey can modify GlobalConfig values (future updates)
//! - **PDA Security**: GlobalConfig is a PDA, so only the program can sign for it
//! - **Economic Immutability**: After initialization, the economic constraints are set
//!   (admin could update them, but this would require additional instructions not yet implemented)
//!
//! ## Error Conditions
//!
//! This instruction will fail if:
//! - GlobalConfig PDA already exists (already initialized)
//! - Caller is not the designated admin (signature validation)
//! - Insufficient lamports for rent (payer balance check)
//!
//! ## On-Chain Logs
//!
//! Successful execution emits:
//! ```text
//! ✅ Fundraisely program initialized
//!    Admin: <admin_pubkey>
//!    Platform wallet: <platform_wallet>
//!    Charity wallet: <charity_wallet>
//! ```
