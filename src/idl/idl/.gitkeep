# IDL Directory

This directory contains the Anchor IDL (Interface Definition Language) JSON files generated from the Solana program build.

## Usage

After building the Solana program, copy the IDL here:

```bash
cd solana-program/fundraisely
anchor build
cp target/idl/fundraisely.json ../../src/idl/
```

The IDL is imported by `useFundraiselyContract.ts` to provide type-safe contract interactions.
