## 🔗 Blockchain Smart Contract Capabilities

### Platform Administration
- ✅ **Initialize platform with one-time setup** - Admin creates GlobalConfig with economic parameters (20% platform fee, max 5% host fee, min 40% charity)
- ✅ **Set platform-wide wallet addresses** - Configure platform wallet and default charity wallet for fund distribution
- ✅ **Enforce economic model constraints** - Automatically validate that platform + host + prize + charity = 100%
- ✅ **Emergency pause functionality** - Admin can pause all platform operations (not yet implemented but state field exists)
- ✅ **Configure fee boundaries** - Set max host fee (500 bps = 5%), max prize pool (3500 bps = 35%), min charity (4000 bps = 40%)

### Room Creation & Management
- ✅ **Create fundraising rooms** - Host creates room with entry fee, max players, prize distribution, and fees in basis points
- ✅ **Support any SPL token** - Rooms can use any fungible SPL token (USDC, USDT, SOL wrapped, custom tokens)
- ✅ **Per-room charity selection** - Each room can specify its own charity wallet address (overrides platform default)
- ✅ **Flexible prize distribution** - Support 6 prize modes (Winner Takes All, Top 2 Split, Top 3 Split, Top 10%, Top 20%, Top 50%)
- ✅ **Custom prize percentages** - Define exact percentage breakdown for each winner position
- ✅ **Set max player capacity** - Enforce room size limits (1-1000 players)
- ✅ **Set optional "extras" fee** - Additional contribution beyond entry fee for bonus prize pool
- ✅ **PDA-based room accounts** - Deterministic room addresses derived from host + roomId seed
- ✅ **Automatic fee validation** - Reject room creation if fee structure violates platform constraints

### Player Participation
- ✅ **Join room with entry fee** - Players pay entry fee in SPL tokens to join room
- ✅ **Optional extras payment** - Players can optionally pay extras fee for larger prize pool
- ✅ **Duplicate join prevention** - Each player can only join a room once (enforced by PDA)
- ✅ **Player receipt creation** - Each join creates immutable PlayerEntry account with payment proof
- ✅ **SPL token transfer** - Automatic transfer from player wallet to room vault
- ✅ **Track join timestamp** - Record blockchain slot when player joined for ordering/fairness
- ✅ **Atomic join operation** - Entry fee + extras + receipt creation happens in single transaction
- ✅ **Player count tracking** - Room.playerCount increments automatically on each join

### Game Execution & Winner Declaration
- ✅ **Declare 1-3 winners** - Host declares between 1 and 3 winners after game completion

### Fund Distribution & Room Closure
- ✅ **Calculate fee splits** - Automatically compute platform fee, host fee, charity amount, prize pool from collected funds

- ✅ **Status state machine** - Enforce valid state transitions (ready → active → ended)
- ✅ **Host self-exclusion** - Prevent host from winning their own room
- ✅ **Entry fee minimum** - Prevent creation of zero-fee or negative-fee rooms
